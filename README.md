# QSPR

## Model Helper Functions
"GCNNhelperFun.py" contains a set of custom defined functions for quickly building, training, and testing Graph CNN's, while "QsarHelperFun.py" quickly builds, trains, and tests sequential models.

## Candidate Generation
"Rxn.Fun.py" contains a set of custom defined functions for generating molecules. The functions work to generatec molecular candidates by reacting biomass-derived precursors with various cheap/easily-accessible reactants via 1-4 step synthetic routes. Reaction functions were created using custom-defined reaction SMARTS and functions from the AllChem package.

## Applicability Domain
"SimAD.py" has custom defined functions for estimating the reliability of predictions for molecules in a dataset.
